Utilities for initializing Ray cluster in a torchrun/SPMD environment.

Based on MosaicML ComposeRL utilities.

Expected environment variables (set by torchrun per-process):
- WORLD_SIZE: Total number of processes
- RANK: Global rank of this process
- LOCAL_RANK: Local rank on this node
- LOCAL_WORLD_SIZE: Number of processes per node
- MASTER_ADDR: IP address of the master node
- MASTER_PORT: Port for torch.distributed rendezvous

    This function sets up a Ray cluster where the master node (rank 0) starts the head node,
    and other nodes connect to it. It handles the coordination between PyTorch distributed
    training and Ray cluster initialization. It assumes torch.distributed
    is already initialized on all ranks and all the associated nodes are joining the ray cluster.

    The function:
    1. Starts Ray head node on rank 0
    2. Broadcasts the Ray address to all other ranks
    3. Connects worker nodes to the head node
    4. Waits for all GPUs to be available before proceeding
